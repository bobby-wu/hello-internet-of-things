Hi everyone!

Bobby, a rookie is here. I like programming, but my school major has nothing to do with computer, sofeware, etc. I only get to know about java and some basic computer knowledges in my spare time, which are far from to make me progam like professionals. So I come here and hope I can learn and persis with programming. Keep rolling and never die.
